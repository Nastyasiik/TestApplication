Program to generate a new array from initial

How it works:
we have 2 private methods that do the work

GetInitialArray: gets amount of words that going to be inserted into an array
                 inserts the words into an array in a loop
                 
GetArrayWithShortenedStrings: uses LINQ to get all the words with length <= 3
